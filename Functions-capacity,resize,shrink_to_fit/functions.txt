Main Topic – Functions
Sub-topic – capacity()

Formal Definition
•	It is a built in function.
•	It tells us the size of the amount of space that is allocated currently.
•	It does not take any parameters.

Easy and Clear Explanation (along with examples)
Example

int cap = vt.capacity()

Here we have taken vt as vector and cap of int datatype to store the capacity of vector.
Solved Questions
#include<iostream>  
#include<vector>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    vector<int> vt{11,22,30};  
    int c=vt.capacity();  
    cout<<"Capacity of the vector is :"<<cap;  
    	    return 0;  
}  

Output 

Capacity of the vector is 3

Main Topic – Functions
Sub-topic – resize()

Formal Definition
•	It is a built in function.
•	It is used for changing the size of the vector.
•	It does not take any parameters.

Easy and Clear Explanation (along with examples)
Example

vt.resize(2,8)

Here we have taken vt as vector.
Solved Questions
#include<iostream>  
#include<vector>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    vector<string>  vt{"Pizza","Burger","Pasta"};  
    cout<<” vt = ";  
    for(int i=0;i<vt.size();i++)  
    cout<<vt[i]<<" ";  
    vt.resize(5,"Noodles");  
    for(int i=0;i<vt.size();i++)  
    cout<<vt[i]<<" ";  
    return 0;  
}

Output
 vt = Pizza , Burger , Pasta , Noodles , Noodles

Practice Questions

Main Topic – Functions
Sub-topic – shrink_to_fit()

Formal Definition
•	It is a built in function.
•	It helps to shrink/reduce the capacity to fit in a size. 
•	It does not take any parameters.

Easy and Clear Explanation (along with examples)
Example

vt.resize(2,8)

Here we have taken vt as vector.
Solved Questions
#include<iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    string s="Funny People";  
    cout<<s.capacity()<<'\n';  
    s.shrink_to_fit();  
    cout<<s.capacity();  
    return 0;  
}  
Output
12
12

Practice Questions
