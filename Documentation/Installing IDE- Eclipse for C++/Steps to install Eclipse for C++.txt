step 1: Download ans Install Mingw (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
Eclipse CDT uses C/C++ Compiler. Hence before we can start using Eclipse CDT for C/C++ development, 
we need to have a proper GCC compiler on our system. We can have ‘MinGW’  compiler on our machine that will be used by eclipse.
